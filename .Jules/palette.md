**Learning:** Using low-contrast colors like `#aaa` for status text on light backgrounds can fail accessibility standards.
**Action:** Use higher contrast colors (e.g., `#767676` or darker) for secondary text to ensure readability for all users.

**Learning:** WCAG AA compliance for text contrast (ratio 4.5:1) typically requires a gray shade like #767676 on white backgrounds, and simple CSS hover states significantly improve interactive scannability.
**Action:** Always check color contrast for "muted" or "absent" text states and add hover effects for table-based data.
